					<h2 id="abouth2">The 2022 /r/place Atlas</h2>
					<p>This is an Atlas aiming to chart all the artworks created during the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/">/r/place</a> April's fools event on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> in 2022.</p>
					<p>The original code was developed by <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="author">Roland Rytz</a> (<a href="mailto:roland.rytz@gmail.com" target="_blank">mail</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/user/draemmli/" target="_blank">reddit</a>) and is available under the free <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">AGPL license</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RolandR/place-atlas">GitHub</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The currently maintained version of the website is managed by <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="author">Stefano Haagmans</a> and is obtainable under the same license within a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas">Github Fork</a>.</p>. Image's provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://place.thatguyalex.com/">Alex Tsernoh</a></p>.
					<p>Maintaining and updating the website takes work, but I enjoy doing it for free and giving this to people. But if you would like to support me, or the people who helped me with contributions to this project. You're free to support us though <a target="_blank" href="https://paypal.me/codixer">Paypal</a>. (I don't have bitcoin)</p>
					<p>To maintain the same tradition, I will also be offering stickers to anyone donating more then 20$ (Due to the size increase). But, you're not forced to do anything! This only shows appreciation to us and the people who've worked on this project</p>
					<br>
					<p>Roland Rytz worked on the Atlas full-time (and more!) for over two weeks during the 2017 r/place event.</p>
					<p>If you'd like to support Roland, you can do so by <a target="_blank" href="https://paypal.me/draemmli">PayPal</a>.</p>
					<p>If you donate more than 10(€/$/CHF/mBTC), He'll (hopefully) send you a nice sticker of the Place canvas! (2017 one)</p>
